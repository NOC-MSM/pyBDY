Function e3_to_depth.

Purpose :   compute t- & w-depths of model levels from e3t & e3w scale factors
Method  :   The t- & w-depth are given by the summation of e3w & e3t, resp.
Action  :   pe3t, pe3w : scale factor of t- and w-point (m)
Useage: [gdept, gdepw] = e3_to_depth(e3t, e3w, nz).

# COMMENT(jelt 5Feb18):
# Since the move from NEMOv3.6 to NEMOv4 we now need to compute the depth variables from e3[tw] metrics.
# Older namelist_dst.ncml files did not have an e3w definition.
# This is now needed to reconstruct depth at w-points.
# However if e3w isn't defined in the *ncml file it is likely that pyBDY will fail here.
